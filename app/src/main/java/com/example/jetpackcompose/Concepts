.... Lecture 8 .... (State Concept - Hoisting & Unidirectional Flow)

        * State means , now in compose lets say there is a count button then it will not increase the counter as we have done
        earlier , now we have to make an counter as an object of mutableState also inside the remember.
        * There is a rememberSaveable that can work as the view model , it will handle the orientation od the device

        * State hoisting - It means the upper level compose will pass the state to all below composable
        * Data providing is up to down and events are bottom to top

        * Whenever we want to execute a line of code once or with some certain condition then we will use LaunchEffect
        to avoid any Side Effects.
